Yard Sales 🏪

It is a React.js SPA of a fictitious mini store. The project consists of different views and pages which are accessed using React Router routes.

The application works client-side for the most part, taking advantage of the storage in localStorage and sessionStorage of the browser, so that the app follows a flow quite similar to that of a real store with its backend.
